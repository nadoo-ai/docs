## Core Capabilities

### 1. Visual Workflow Design

Create workflows using intuitive visual components:
- **Node Library**: Drag nodes from the sidebar
- **Connection Logic**: Connect nodes to define flow
- **Property Panels**: Configure node behavior
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes instantly

### 2. Integration with Flow Core

Every visual workflow compiles to Flow Core code:
- Visual nodes map to Flow Core nodes
- Connections become pipe operators
- Properties translate to node configuration
- Full compatibility with code-based workflows

### 3. Template System

Accelerate development with pre-built templates:
- Customer support chatbots
- Document processing pipelines
- Data analysis workflows
- Integration patterns

### 4. Collaboration Features

Work together effectively:
- Real-time multi-user editing
- Version control and history
- Comments and annotations
- Role-based access control

## Platform Components

### Frontend (Next.js + React)

- **React**: For workflow visualization
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS**: Modern styling
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)

- **Workflow Compiler**: Converts visual to code
- **Execution Manager**: Orchestrates Flow Core
- **API Gateway**: RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- **Auth System**: JWT-based authentication

### Data Layer

- **PostgreSQL**: Workflow definitions and metadata
- **Redis**: Session management and caching
- **S3**: Asset and artifact storage

## Example: Building a Chatbot

Here's how a simple chatbot looks in Builder vs Flow Core:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Visual Builder">
    ```yaml
    # Visual representation (simplified)
    nodes:
      - id: input
        type: UserInput
        position: {x: 100, y: 100}

      - id: llm
        type: LLMNode
        position: {x: 300, y: 100}
        config:
          model: gpt-4
          temperature: 0.7

      - id: output
        type: ResponseOutput
        position: {x: 500, y: 100}

    edges:
      - source: input
        target: llm
      - source: llm
        target: output
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Generated Flow Core">
    ```python
    from nadoo_flow import ChainableNode, LLMNode, FunctionNode

    workflow = (
        FunctionNode(lambda x: {"message": x["user_input"]})
        | LLMNode(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
        | FunctionNode(lambda x: {"response": x["content"]})
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
